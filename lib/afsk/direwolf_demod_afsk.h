 * It can also be used for multiple demodulators with the same
 * frequency but other differing parameters.
 * Each subchannel has its own demodulator and HDLC decoder.
 *
 * In version 1.2 we added multiple SLICERS.
 * The data structure, here, has multiple slicers per
 * demodulator (subchannel).  Due to fuzzy thinking or
 * expediency, the multiple slicers got mapped into subchannels.
 * This means we can't use both multiple decoders and
 * multiple slicers at the same time.

 * Clean this up in 1.3 and keep the concepts separate.

 * Name:        pll_dcd_signal_transition2

 * Purpose:     New DCD strategy for 1.6.
 *
 * Inputs:	D		Pointer to demodulator state.
 *
 *		chan		Radio channel: 0 to MAX_CHANS - 1
 *
 *		subchan		Which of multiple demodulators: 0 to MAX_SUBCHANS - 1
 *
 *		slice		Slicer number: 0 to MAX_SLICERS - 1.
 *
 *		dpll_phase	Signed 32 bit counter for DPLL phase.
 *				Wraparound is where data is sampled.
 *				Ideally transitions would occur close to 0.
 *
 * Output:	D->slicer[slice].data_detect - true when PLL is locked to incoming signal.
 *
 * Description:	From the beginning, DCD was based on finding several flag octets
 *		in a row and dropping when eight bits with no transitions.
 *		It was less than ideal but we limped along with it all these years.
 *		This fell apart when FX.25 came along and a couple of the
 *		correlation tags have eight "1" bits in a row.
 *
 * 		Our new strategy is to keep a running score of how well demodulator
 *		output transitions match to where expected.
